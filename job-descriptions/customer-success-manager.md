We have strong product-market fit, with thousands of daily active users inside of some of the world’s most elite software firms. As we grow, we need you to help ensure that every customer is getting the full value out of the product and considers it a success internally.

- Work with our Developer Relations team to organize traning sessions, webinars, and brown bag lunches to educate end-users on Sourcegraph and drive engagement.

#### Ideal candidates have

- Experience working in a go-to-market function (such as Sales, Success, Developer Relations, or Support) that involves direct engagement with customers and end users.
- An organized approach to work, with demonstrated ability to manage a large pipeline of projects/clients, to make difficult prioritization decisions, and to use data to guide decision-making.
- A passion for and excitement about software development (no training as an engineer required).
- Enthusiasm for building a new team and new strategy from scratch, and working on challenging open-ended problems.
- Comfort speaking publicly.
